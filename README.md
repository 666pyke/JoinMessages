# JoinMessages

● A **Minecraft** plugin that allows you to add **special messages** when a player **joins** or **leaves** the server. 

● This plugin lets you set **special messages** for **Donors**, **Staff Members**, or even for **all** players.
Configuration:
```
donator:
  join-message: "%user% joined the server"
  leave-message: "%user% left the server"
  permission: joinmessages.donator

staff:
  join-message: "%user% joined the server"
  leave-message: "%user% left the server"
  permission: joinmessages.staff

default:
  join-message: "%user% joined the server"
  leave-message: "%user% left the server"
  permission: joinmessages.default
```

● This **plugin** can also completely **disable** the messages that appear when someone joins or leaves the server, which can be annoying or visually unappealing.
